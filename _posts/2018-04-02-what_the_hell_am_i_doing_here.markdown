By 2008, I was completely burned-out working in the restaurant business. I had met a lot of good people and done a lot of good things, but it was time to do something else. My wife and I decided that it was time for me to go back to school. I quit my job, started working in a factory as a machinist at night, and worked on my MBA during the day for the next 3 years.

Since that time, it's been a never-ending unsuccessful search for meaningful employment. I've stayed busy by completely remodeling and flipping 3 of our personal residences (the 3rd flip is in progress), volunteered my time coaching high school football, built another kayak, and continued to earn a paycheck machining or welding in a couple other factories. Nothing has blossomed into the meaningful next career that I had envisioned, and opportunities appear to be scarcer now than ever before.

I came to the realization that without updating/adding more technical skills, I'll continue to flounder. My son had been investigating programming bootcamps for a while. He shared the information with me, and we both decided to go through Flatiron's curriculum together. He'll be starting later this week.

I'm excited to be learning, looking forward to meeting more good people, and very hopeful for the future.
