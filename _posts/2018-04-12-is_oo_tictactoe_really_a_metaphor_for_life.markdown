One of the emphasis points at the beginning of both of Avi's *Intro. to Object Orientation* videos is that in OO Ruby we're dealing with symbols, and each of those symbols acts as a metaphor for an actual desired outcome. There is nothing tangible about the symbols we're creating, but the output of those conjoined symbols creates a useful tool.

In a similar way, the process of creating *OO TicTacToe* can be considered a metaphor for each of our lives. As with any endeavor, we begin the journey with a little knowledge, some desire to learn, and a lot of trepidation. 

For the Flatiron staff, it must be like watching a baby learn how to walk:

*  First you see them pull themselves up with the edge of the coffee table  #=>(beginning *Classes and Instances*)
*  Then they shuffle to the couch while still hanging onto the coffee table  #=>(*Instance Methods*)
*  Then they fall - hopefully on their padded butts and not their unprotected chins  #=>(time to review the previous 3-5 modules)
*  Then they pull themselves up again with a little hesitation - gotta make sure that Mom or Dad is watching this time  #=>(visit to "Ask A Question/Screen Share")
*  Then they look around and think, "I got this!"  #=>(time to tackle *Instance Variables*)
*  Take a step or two  #=>(*Object Attributes* and *Object Initialization*)
*  Fall down again  #=>(If it's a hard fall, we start screaming like babies in "Ask A Question." If we happen to land softly, we generally pull ourselves up again and move on to *OO Barking Dog*)
*  Baby gets back up, feeling good about him/herself, gonna take a little stroll around the living room, **BAM!**,  tripped over the toys left in the middle of the floor  #=>(got stuck on the first method creating our TicTacToe board)
*  Laying on the floor crying and thinking ***"WTF!"***  #=>("Do I really have to suck it up and go back to "Ask A Question"? Maybe one of my "Friends" is online and I can get a hand. Hey! Wait a minute! There's this little thing called Google!) 
*  Grab onto the rocking chair, pull her/himself back up, take a few more steps, **WHAM!**, where did that wall come from?  #=>(forgot an `end` in my `#turn` method and got stuck for an hour, "I know my code is right. There must be something wrong with this IDE!")
*  NAP TIME!  #=>(I gotta step away from this f@#$in' computer before I throw it through a wall)
*  All rested, feeling good, Mom's taking me to the park!  #=>( found the stupid mistake and knocked out a few more methods)
*  Baby thinks, "Mom's not gonna hold my hand!" then yanks free and takes off running  #=>(`44 examples, 0 failures` -> Type out `learn submit` then act like a fool for a minute doing the happy dance)
*  Baby grows up, becomes a teenager, and you never have a decent conversation with him/her again until the age of 25  #=>(Nah . . . I wouldn't do that to the Flatiron staff. . . at least I hope not . . . besides I still have a long way tyo go!!!)
