SYNTAX!!! 

Without the Code-Alongs it would have been diificult-to-impossible to complete the Scraping Labs without outside resources.  As with the majority of topics thus far in this program, the requirement of precise syntax is a minefield that must be properly navigated. The accompanying videos and Google search links were necessary to help gain a comfortable understanding of the material.

If I was explaining the scraping process to my Mom, I would first have to ensure her that I really don't need Neosporin, a Band-Aid, or medical attention. Then I would watch her eyes glaze and wait for her to change the subject to something more appropriate to her daily activities.
